# evetools
tool box to enjoy eveonline

first object of this project is to make a tool to give the info of avaiable module in asset for fitting
maybe several parts will be needed to make this tool
- fetch asset data from eve
- read EFT fit format and list modules to be used for the fit
- check asset and give the info how many modules are avaiable or missing to fit the ship

it would be great if i can learn
- how to use SSO / oauth and to use ESI
- python/php which is good to develop
